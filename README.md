# Philosophy Timeline
## An interactive timeline of philosophy

### Repository Location:
https://github.com/the-blackhall-projects/philosophy-timeline

### Live page
https://the-blackhall-projects.github.io/philosophy-timeline/index.html

This is an attemp to provide a timeline of philosophy using generated content.  As well as displaying the timeline, the user can sign up for a newsletter and find further content on social media sites.

Use has been made of the Code Institute's "Love Running" project for the newsletter signup form.

The text content (but not CSS and HTML code) has been machine generated by ChatGPT. 

## Site user's goal:
The siteâ€™s users are interested in the historical facts about philosophy.

##  Site owner's goal:

The goal of the site is to provide a reliable source of information pertaining to the history of philosophy.

Site includes:

*    A timeline of periods, schools and movements in philosophy.
*    Ability to expand a particular timeline entry to gain more background and further timeline entries.
*    Images are provided to add context to the text in question.

The website is incomplete as a fully complete site would require hundreds of pages.  However the intention here is to demonstrate techniques in HTML and CSS rather than completeness.
