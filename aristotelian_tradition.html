				<h2>Reasoned Realism, Empirical Exploration.</h2>
				<h3>The Aristotelian Tradition
					from 384 to 322 BCE</h3>


				<p>The Aristotelian tradition, named after the Greek philosopher Aristotle, refers to the intellectual
					and philosophical ideas that emerged during the period from 384 to 322 BCE. Aristotle was one of the
					most prominent philosophers of his time and his ideas and teachings had a profound influence on
					Western philosophy and thought. His work encompassed many fields, including metaphysics, ethics,
					politics, biology, and logic.</p>

				<p>Aristotle was born in 384 BCE in Stagira, a small town in northern Greece. He was the son of a
					physician and spent much of his early life studying science and medicine. Later, he studied under
					the famous philosopher Plato in Athens, where he developed his own philosophical ideas and became
					known as one of the greatest thinkers of his time.</p>

				<p>Aristotle's philosophy was based on observation and empirical evidence. He believed that knowledge
					came from experience and that the universe was made up of matter and form. He also believed that
					everything had a purpose or function, and that this purpose could be discovered through observation
					and analysis.</p>

				<p>In his work on metaphysics, Aristotle developed the concept of causality, which stated that
					everything had a cause and that these causes could be understood through logical reasoning. He also
					argued that the universe was infinite and eternal, and that there was a prime mover or first cause
					that set everything in motion.</p>

				<p>In addition to his work on metaphysics, Aristotle made significant contributions to ethics and
					politics. He believed that human beings had a natural inclination towards virtuous behavior and that
					this behavior could be cultivated through education and practice. He also argued that the best form
					of government was a constitutional monarchy, where power was shared between the ruler and the
					people.</p>

				<p>Aristotle's work on logic was also groundbreaking. He developed a system of deductive reasoning known
					as syllogism, which is still used today in fields such as mathematics and computer science.</p>

				<p>Overall, the Aristotelian tradition had a profound impact on Western thought and philosophy.
					Aristotle's ideas on metaphysics, ethics, politics, and logic continue to influence our
					understanding of the world today. His legacy can be seen in the work of many great thinkers
					throughout history, including Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
