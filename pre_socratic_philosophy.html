				<h3>Pre-Socratic Philosophy
					from 624 to 450 BCE</h3>

				<p>Pre-Socratic philosophy refers to the period of ancient Greek philosophy that occurred before the
					time of Socrates. It is also known as the Presocratic period and spans from 624 to 450 BCE. During
					this time, philosophers sought to understand the nature of reality, the universe, and human
					existence through observation and rational thinking, rather than relying on myths and religious
					beliefs.</p>

				<p>One of the most prominent Pre-Socratic philosophers was Thales of Miletus, who lived from 624 to 546
					BCE. Thales believed that everything in the universe was made of water and that water was the
					primary substance from which all other things were created. His idea of a universal substance was a
					significant step towards a naturalistic approach to understanding the universe, as opposed to a
					supernatural one.</p>

				<p>Another influential Pre-Socratic philosopher was Heraclitus of Ephesus, who lived from 535 to 475
					BCE. Heraclitus believed that change was the fundamental nature of reality and that everything was
					in a state of flux. He is famous for saying, "No man ever steps in the same river twice." This idea
					of perpetual change laid the foundation for the philosophy of process and became a significant theme
					in later philosophical schools.</p>

				<p>Parmenides of Elea was another important Pre-Socratic philosopher, who lived from 515 to 450 BCE.
					Parmenides argued that reality was one unchanging, eternal, and indivisible entity. He believed that
					change and movement were an illusion, and the universe was static. His ideas about the nature of
					being and non-being influenced later philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.</p>

				<p>Other notable Pre-Socratic philosophers include Anaximenes, who believed that air was the primary
					substance, and Empedocles, who believed that the universe was made up of four elements: earth,
					water, air, and fire.</p>

				<p>Pre-Socratic philosophy played a crucial role in the development of Western thought, laying the
					groundwork for the subsequent philosophical movements. These philosophers sought to understand the
					nature of the universe and human existence through rational thinking and observation, paving the way
					for the scientific method. They challenged traditional religious beliefs and myths and offered new
					ways of looking at the world, which had a profound impact on the development of Western
					civilization.</p>
