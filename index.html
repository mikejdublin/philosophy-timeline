				<h2>A Journey Through Time, The Quest for Understanding</h2>
				<h3>Philosophy from c. 624 BCE to present</h3>


				<p>Philosophy is a discipline that has been at the forefront of intellectual inquiry for thousands of years. At its core, philosophy is concerned with exploring fundamental questions about the nature of reality, knowledge, ethics, and existence. Philosophers use reason and critical thinking to engage with these questions and attempt to provide thoughtful and reasoned answers. Through philosophical inquiry, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, the world around us, and our place in it.</p>

				<p>One of the central questions that philosophy asks is "what is knowledge?" Philosophers have explored this question for centuries, seeking to understand what we can know, how we can know it, and how we can be sure that our knowledge is reliable. Other central questions include "what is the meaning of life?", "what is the nature of reality?", "what is the relationship between mind and body?", and "what is the basis of moral and ethical judgments?"</p>
					
				<p>This timeline helps us gain a deeper understanding of philosophy by presenting an overview of the major periods and schools of thought that have emerged over the course of history. By examining these periods and schools, we can see how different philosophers have approached these fundamental questions and how their ideas have influenced subsequent generations. Additionally, by exploring the various movements within philosophy, we can begin to identify the key debates, theories, and concepts that have shaped the discipline over time. By gaining a deeper understanding of philosophy, we can better appreciate the value of critical thinking and reasoned inquiry, and how these skills can help us to engage with the world more thoughtfully and effectively.</p>
